# native-chat-app

# About
This application is a simple chat app built with React-Native, Expo, Gifted-Chat, and Google Firebase.
It allows users to enter their name, select their theme color, and (with user permission) send messages/images/location data in a responsive chat environment.

# Installation
Clone the repository and run `npm install` from within the project's root directory to install all necessary dependencies.

This app requires the Expo-Cli to run a development server.
  - From within the terminal: `npm i -g expo-cli`
  
Then, in the projects root directory, run `npm run start`

This will launch the expo dev tools and from there you can run the app in your browser or scan the QR code from your mobile device using the Expo Go app.
